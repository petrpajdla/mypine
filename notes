# Notes on my Pinebook pro

I sort of liked the default KDE Plasma, but there were just too many bells and whistles and since I was using BunsenLabs Helium for several last years,
I found these many clicking options overwhelming.
On the other and, I was thinking about switching to Manjaro for a long time, since several friends recommended it (thanks goes to nevrome and dakni).
But in the end I decided to go with the i3 window manager. One reason is that it is developed by official (?) Manjaro ARM team.
The other I sort of liked the idea of most of the control done using keyboard shortcuts and i3 was somwhere recommended for newbies 
starting with tiling window managers.

FYI I recommned an introduction on window managers with live demos by ?? <youtube link>.

## Booting from SD card

So in the forums <link> I stumbled upon some threads that mentioned that not all the 
SD cards work, someone recommended San Disk Ultra 16 GB Micro SDHC (Class I), I bought this one and it worked just fine.
Before that, I tried Kingston Micro SDHC 16 GB (Class I). This one failed to boot.
Regarding the San Disk SD card - the vendor labeled it "Ultra Android", no worries with that, imho just a trick to make bfus think some SD cards are *better* for the phones with Android..

## Installing from SD card

All te guides say in bold type to chooose the correct version of the install file.
There are usually two versions of the install file, one is labeled as the correct one for flashing to the eMMC.
Of course I (unaware of that) chose the other one.
It booted nicely and did the install. Only problem being that it installed on the SD card.
So check twice which version are you flashing to the SD card.

## Flashing the SD card

I used balena software recommended by Manjaro team <github repo link>. It can be used to flash any image to the SD card, some can be downloaded through it, 
very simpel to use, runs under Windows, Linux, anything I suppose (did not manage to run it on the Pinebook Pro under Manjaro  KDE Plasma though, but also I did not spend too much time trying).

The install process is then quite straightforward, shove the SD card in the reader (this might be the most difficult step along with removing it).
Boot from it, follow the instructions on the screen.
The install took only several minutes in my case, then the system reboots and you are supposed to remove the SD from the slot.


## Problems

* PBP does not go to sleep, or, the sleep is interrupted by the lid being closed. Then the battery is drained.



## Setting up Czech keyboard layout

Change a file in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`, it is named `00-keyboard.conf` and 
line `Option "XkbLayout" "cz"` must be changed...

## Changing settings of i3 window manager

Guide: <https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#configuring>

* Original file in `/etc/i3/config`
* Edit file in `~/.i3/config`

* Change main `mod` key to `super` 


## Repair boot/sleep

It won't go to sleep. CLosing the lid interrupts the sleep and completely drains the battery.
There might be a fix in mrfixit2001 updates...
